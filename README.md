# Migrana

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/migrana.svg)](https://clojars.org/migrana)

Migrana is a Datomic migration tool loosely inspired in a mix of
[conformity](https://github.com/rkneufeld/conformity) and
[Rails' Active Record Migrations](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html).

Migrana gives you the control over how your Datomic database evolves. It
allows you to either write migrations and ensure that they run once and
only once or let Migrana infer schema evolution to you.

## Motivation

Datomic and its immutable nature simplifies migrations tremendously in
comparison to more traditional databases. However, every now and again, a
few things need change along the way. Two common scenarios are:

1. When schema changes are not trivial and you end up needing to deal with
   alterations that are not directly possible without a few interventions
   beforehand (see [Altering Schema Attributes](http://docs.datomic.com/schema.html#altering-schema-attributes)
   for more details). An example would be for instance setting an attribute
   as `:db/unique`. Since uniqueness will be enforced, then making sure that
   a separate, intermediary transaction takes care of such conflict cases will
   guarantee that the new setting gets applied successfully.
2. When there are data transformations as part of the migration. An example
   is a hypothetical situation for example where all entities that used to
   have `:card/ratings` attribute now also need a default
   `:card/has-been-rated?` attached to them).

## Getting Started

TBD

## Usage

Let's assume you have a Datomic schema file on `resources/schema.edn`:

```clojure
[{:db/ident :person/name
  :db/valueType :db.type/string
  :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one}
 {:db/ident :person/relationship-status
  :db/valueType :db.type/ref
  :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one
  :db/doc "Whether the person is married or single."}
 {:db/ident :relationship-status/single}
 {:db/ident :relationship-status/married}
 {:db/ident :relationship-status/divorced}
 {:db/ident :relationship-status/widowed}]]
```

Then run:

```
$ lein migrana datomic:dev://localhost:4334/my-db
```

_Note_: If you have the environment variable `DATOMIC_URI` set, you can call
`lein migrana` and it will connect to the DB specified there.

Migrana will make sure that your schema is in the DB and will also create a
migration for you at `resources/migrations` with the timestamp
`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_schema_inference.edn`. I.e.:

```
$ ls resources/migrations
20171124200143_schema_inference.edn
```

If you run `lein migrana` again, Migrana will not do anything because it
will detect that the schema file is unchanged and that it has already
been asserted into the DB.

If you check the contents of `20171124200143_schema_inference.edn` you'll see:

```clojure
{:tx-data [{:db/ident :person/name
            :db/valueType :db.type/string
            :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one}
           {:db/ident :person/relationship-status
            :db/valueType :db.type/ref
            :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one
            :db/doc "Whether the person is married or single."}
           {:db/ident :relationship-status/single}
           {:db/ident :relationship-status/married}
           {:db/ident :relationship-status/divorced}
           {:db/ident :relationship-status/widowed}]}
```

Now, let's suppose we need to add a new attribute for `:person/email`
which we wish to be an identity and let's also add an index to `:person/name`.
Let's change our `resources/schema.edn` to:

```clojure
[{:db/ident :person/name
  :db/valueType :db.type/string
  :db/index true
  :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one}
 {:db/ident :person/email
  :db/valueType :db.type/string
  :db/unique :db.type/identity
  :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one}
 {:db/ident :person/relationship-status
  :db/valueType :db.type/ref
  :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one
  :db/doc "Whether the person is married or single."}
 {:db/ident :relationship-status/single}
 {:db/ident :relationship-status/married}
 {:db/ident :relationship-status/divorced}
 {:db/ident :relationship-status/widowed}]]
```

After the change we run `lein migrana` again:

```
$ lein migrana datomic:dev://localhost:4334/my-db
```

And let's check what Migrana has done to our `resources/migrations`:

```
$ ls resources/migrations
20171124200143_schema_inference.edn 20171124200525_schema_inference.edn
```

When you check the content of the new file
(`20171124200525_schema_inference.edn`), this is what you have:

```clojure
{:tx-data [{:db/ident :person/name
            :db/index true}
           {:db/ident :person/email
            :db/valueType :db.type/string
            :db/unique :db.type/identity
            :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one}]}
```

## Schema Inference

You probably noticed that, until now, the migration files are named 
`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_schema_inference.edn`. That's because running `lein migrana`
as we have been doing will use its schema inference features (Migrana
will infer the migration required based on how the Datomic schema file
has changed).

Migrana can detect only additions (such as we have seen before). Anything
else more advanced will require a manual migration.

## Manual Migrations

In some cases, the schema inference done by Migrana is not enough. In such
cases you can create a manual migration with:

```
$ lein migrana create retract_name
```

This will create the migration `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_retract_name.edn` in
the `resources/migrations` path:

```
$ ls resources/migrations
20171124200143_schema_inference.edn 20171124200525_schema_inference.edn 20171124200733_retract_name.edn`
```

The file will be empty and you can write your own migration steps in as a
vector of the `:tx-data` map entry.

After you edit the file, you can run `lein migrana` as usual and your
migration will be sent to the DB.

## Migrations as Code

In some cases you might want to have code that interacts with your manual
migratation. In these cases, simply create an empty manual migration with:

```
$ lein migrana create code_as_migration
```

Then open the migration created in `resources/migrations` and edit to look
like something like this:

```clojure
{:tx-fn 'my-project.migrations/backport-bar-attr-to-entities-with-foo}
```

Then in your `src/my_project/migrations.clj` you could have:

```clojure
(ns my-project.migrations
  (:require [datomic.api :as d])

(def find-eids-with-attr
  '[:find [?e ...]
    :in $ ?attr
    :where
    [?e ?attr]])

(defn backport-bar-attr-to-entities-with-foo
  "Find existing entities bearing the `:some/foo` attribute,
   and apply to them the `:some/bar` attribute and value."
  [conn]
  (let [foo-eids (d/q find-eids-with-attr (d/db conn) :some/foo)
        tx-data  (for [eid foo-eids]
                   {:db/id eid
                    :some/bar :bar-value})]
    tx-data))
```

After you edit the file, you can run `lein migrana` as usual and your
migration will be sent to the DB.

## Options

TBD: how to specify other edn than resources/schema.edn?
TBD: how to specify a different folder than resources/migrations? - is this
a good idea?
TBD: param to forcefully set the DB to some version and/or re-execute a set
TBD: param to run without schema inference
